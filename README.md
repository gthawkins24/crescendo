      ## Description
      undefined Crescendo is a Reddit-like, music-centered, social media site.
      Users can create Circles (similar to communities), create threads in discussion boards and add comments
      
      

      ## Installation
      undefined Technologies Used: Auth0, Express, EJS, CSS, Nodemon, Node, Heroku, Bootstrap, Sequelize

  
      ## Usage
      undefined Crescendo is a simple site that allows for the sharing of music/bands/songs in threads that are grouped with similar styles/genres of music.
      As music fans, we found that most social media platforms can be convoluted with new music discovery. We wanted a platform that makes it easier to find other people with similar music tastes.
      As a user, I can create a Circle around a single musical topic where other users can make posts centered around that topic and comment on each otherâ€™s posts, fostering conversation and musical discovery.
